# FuzzBuddy

The overall goal of this project: To recreate the famous "Fuzz Face" guitar pedal from 1966 in our own way.

This is the Fuzz Face guitar pedal that has been used by many popular artists such as Jimi Hendrix.

This was the main schematic that was used to create the "FuzzBudy" circuit. The main differences between the two are mainly the values used as resistors and potentiometers.

This is the FuzzBuddy circuit that we have created. Of course, it is naturally very similar to the original, however there are a few differences that make the FuzzBuddy stand out. One such difference is the filter at the end of the circuit, with the capacitor being in parallel with the resistor that goes to ground. A few more key differences are the values on all of the resistor and potentiometer values that can allow for a different sound.

These are the simulation results of the circuit we created. The green wave is the input
